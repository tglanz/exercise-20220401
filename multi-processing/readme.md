# multi-processing

Demonstrate multi processing techniques by implementing 2 processes communicating data between.

## Execution

__Virtual Environment__

It is recommended to work from within an isolated python environment to avoid collisions with the system dependencies and/or other projects.

Create a virtual environment located at ```.venv```

    python3 -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment located ```.venv```

    source .venv/bin/activate
